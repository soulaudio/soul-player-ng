//! App-managed player state: owns the `AudioPlayer` actor (spawned lazily over
//! `CpalSink` on first folder open) and the current `Library`, and forwards the
//! actor's `Event`s to the webview over the Tauri event system.
//!
//! `SOUL_PLAYER_OFFLINE=1` swaps in a no-op `NullSink` so the full command/event
//! wiring can be smoke-tested without an audio device.
